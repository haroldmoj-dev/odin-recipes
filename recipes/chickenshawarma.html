    <p>This chicken shawarma is made with flavorful chicken thighs marinated in a spiced yogurt. Slice the cooked chicken and serve in pita bread with tomato, sliced onion, and my homemade tahini sauce for a popular Middle Eastern sandwich.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup malt vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom</li>
        <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced onion</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>8 pita bread rounds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the marinade: Combine malt vinegar, 1/4 cup yogurt, vegetable oil, mixed spice, cardamom, salt, and pepper together in a glass baking dish.</li>
        <li>Add chicken thighs to the mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). To make the tahini sauce: Combine tahini, 1/4 cup yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and parsley together in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper, taste, and adjust flavors if desired. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Cover the chicken and bake in the marinade for 30 minutes, turning once. Uncover, and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until chicken is browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the dish, and cut into slices.</li>
        <li>Place sliced chicken, tomato, onion, and lettuce onto pita breads. Roll up, and top with tahini sauce.</li>
    </ol>
