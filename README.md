# odin-recipes

This project was made while following a course of TheOdinProject. It demonstrates some basic HTML concepts including:
- Adding text and images
- Linking text to another page
- Linking text to an external website  

The website features three recipes, each having their own page showcasing an image, its ingredients, and its step-by-step instructions:
